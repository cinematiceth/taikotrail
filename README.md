Taiko Trail is a short story about a village lost somewhere in the mountains and an old farmer. The farmer asks the user for help, and if the user agrees, the game starts collecting onchain data from Taiko Network and shows the player all available options based on this data.

Some of the conditions are secret, but they are all simple. Some of them are: getting a Taiko airdrop, having a certain balance, having Taiko tokens, having Cinematic NFTs, subscribing to a channel in Farcaster, etc.
